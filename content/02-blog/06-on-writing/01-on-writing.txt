April 9, 2014.

As you may or may not know, I have recently relaunched my blog/portfolio. As a developer, I feel the need to solve the same problem I have already previously solved every eight months. As the people that work and make the web, we know what is "in" and so we know and feel when one of our creations looks stale. One more thing that I have noted is that for every blog relaunch that we make, we always make that same empty promise to actually start writing. Yet, very few of us actually start writing.

As someone who relies on blog posts on almost a daily basis, writing should be the primary focus of our websites. I don't know about you, but unless something strikes me as cool, I will not "right click > inspect element," so as long as everything looks good and validates, we should be satisfied with our work, specially considering that you will be launching a redesign later this year.

As someone who has also made the same empty promise of starting to write, I will once again make that promise. This time, I intend to keep it. I will try to add new content every week. Two things that I want to keep in mind while writing are that  I will be my main audience and the content will probably suck (at first). Just like with my coding, it will get better with time.

Here are a few links that have motivated me to restart and that will serve as inspiration:
