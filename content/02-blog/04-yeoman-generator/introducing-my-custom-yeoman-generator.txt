I just wanted to formally introduce one of my recent repos, a custom Yeoman generator. It is still in its infancy and thus needs a lot of work.

After using a similar project structure to kickstart prototypes, I have decided to invest sometime in actually writting the generator.

I'm not expecting it go gain traction since it is very opinionated and until I decide to change my workflow, I will probably not add many more features.

At the time of writting the generator can or should:

* Handle SCSS files
* Be ready to deploy through SSH
* Spin up a basic server
* Concat your js
* Autoprefix compiled css
* Watch your files for changes

I have not had the time in the last week to revist it, but there are still a few features to add, such as:

* JSHint your files
* Run Grunt on only edited files
* More?

I still haven't been able to really sit down and look at other features that I can implement or check that I'm following Yeoman best practices, but I just wanted to get this ball rolling. You can find the repo (link: https://github.com/amejias101/generator-experiment-starter text: here).
