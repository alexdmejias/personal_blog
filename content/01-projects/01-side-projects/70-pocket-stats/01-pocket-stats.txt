Excerpt: Keeping Track of My Pocket Queue
----
Text:
Under Heavy Development.

Curious about how much I was falling behind in my (link:https://getpocket.com/about/ text:Pocket) reading list, I decided to graph the amount of articles in it.

Right now, the project is built on D3 and Laravel. Through the use of a cron job, the application can query the Pocket servers and compare them against the last entry made, if the two numbers are different, and through my RESTful api I can add and control existing points.

The project is still in development, but when completed it should have a nicer graph that contains more information, use AngularJS, and allow other users to track their own progress.
