Curious about how much I was falling behind in my Pocket reading list, I decided to graph the amount of articles in it.

Right now, the project is built on D3 and Laravel. By running a cron job every 5 minutes, I can query the Pocket servers and compare them against the last entry made, if the two numbers are different, a new entry will be created, thus adding a new point to the graph.

The project is still in development but when completed it should have a nicer graph that contains more information and allow other users to register and start tracking their own progress.
